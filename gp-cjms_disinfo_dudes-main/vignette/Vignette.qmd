# Introduction

The "Development Differences Visualizer" R Shiny App allows users to explore and compare economic development indicators across countries worldwide. This tutorial will guide you through using the app to extract meaningful insights about global development.

This app is designed for individuals interested in understanding global economic trends without requiring advanced statistical knowledge. It enables users to visualize comparisons and analyze economic outcomes across nations.

# Installation and Setup

To get started, ensure you have the following R packages installed: Shiny, Ggplot2, Tidyverse, Plotly, Readxl, and Dplyr.

# Data Overview

The primary data sources for the "Development Differences Visualizer" app include:

-   HDR Composite Indices: Complete time series data from HDR (Human Development Reports), providing a comprehensive set of indicators for various countries.

-   World Bank Data: A collection of development indicators from the World Bank, which includes economic, social, and governance indicators.

-   Polity Data: Data concerning political structures and stability, offering insights into the governance quality of different countries.

-   World Bank Classification: Classifies countries based on income, region, and other socioeconomic factors.

## Data Structure

The app utilizes multiple data frames derived from the raw datasets, which undergo several stages of cleaning and transformation:

HDR Data Cleaning:

Selection of relevant columns from the HDR dataset. Renaming columns for consistency and clarity. Pivoting HDI score columns to a long format with pivot_longer() function, including conversion of years to numeric format. A glimpse into the cleaned HDR data is provided to check the structure and cleanliness.

World Bank Data Integration:

Merging of World Bank Data with Polity data. Removal of extraneous columns and renaming of year columns. Pivoting data to a long format for more accessible analysis and filtering for years post-1960. Further pivoting of Series Name columns to a wide format.

Combined Dataset Creation:

Joining the cleaned HDR data with the World Bank data to create a comprehensive dataset. Renaming and selecting relevant columns, focusing on key economic and demographic indicators. Rearranging data columns to facilitate user understanding and analysis. Converting key variables to numeric format to ensure accurate statistical computations. Dropping missing values for the Region column to ensure data quality.

## Number of Observations

The "Development Differences Visualizer" app processes a rich and diverse set of data, spanning multiple decades and covering a wide range of development indicators. The data is organized as follows:

-   HDR Data (hdr_data_cleaned): Consists of 6,592 observations, each representing an annual record for a country, across 5 variables.

-   Polity Data (polity_data): Contains 798 observations with detailed political data across 67 variables.

-   Combined World Bank Data (world_bank_data_wide): Features 16,758 observations in a wide format, offering a broad perspective with 14 variables.

-   Rearranged and Combined Data (rearranged_data): The final cleaned dataset that the app uses has a substantial 393,120 observations across 13 variables, indicating a comprehensive and extensive data collection process.

These observations provide a robust foundation for the app's analytic capabilities, allowing users to explore development data from 1960 to 2022

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Tab 2: Economic Data Visualizer

![](www/image 2.png)

This interface allows selecting and comparing economic data between countries.

There are two drop-down menus for selecting countries:

-   Users can select from a range of economic and human development variables including GDP, R&D Expenditure, Government Debt, HDI, Rule of Law, and others. This feature allows users to select multiple indicators at the same time, which will create multiple plots accordingly.

-   In the View mode, users choose from comparing the indicators for both countries or a single plot that measures the difference between two countries.

-   Users can also Normalize values to 100 in reference year, which will show data in normalized values as per a particular reference year which can be chosen using the slider Reference Year at the bottom.

# Statistical Analysis

## Tab 3: Development Visualizer

This interface allows users to select a region and create a statistical model that compares economic and human development for a specific year:

-   The first drop-down menu selects the year.

-   The second selects the region the user wants an analysis of. They can choose from South Asia, North America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and others. Users can also select all regions.

-   The third drop-down menu selects the X variable for the model, the user can select several indicators including GDP, R&D Expenditure, Government Debt, HDI, Rule of Law, etc.

-   The fourth allows for the select of a Y Variable, with the same choices for indicators as the X variable menu .

-   Users can also select the color drop-down to color-code the data points on a chart based on their chosen indicator.

-   The Size drop-down changes the size of data points according to the indicator selected. Users can also log the variables using the log scale X and log scale Y options, along with running a linear regression.
